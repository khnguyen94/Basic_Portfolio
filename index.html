                                    Hi reader, thanks for visiting my site. Without overwhelming you, here is a short
                                    introduction...
                                    My full name is Khoa Anh Nguyen and I am 24 years old.
                                    Born in Vietnam, my family and I came here in 1995
                                    when I was super young (just over a year old).
                                    Since then, I have pretty much lived in Seattle my entire life. I love it here.
                                    After highschool, I decided to take my talents to the East Coast where I attended
                                    college at Davidson College in North Carolina.
                                    Upon graduating, I moved back home and took up a job in environmental consulting.
                                </p>

                                <p class="para">
                                    It was soon thereafter that I started having a quarter-life crisis.
                                    I realized I wanted to work for myself. Working for other people and having to
                                    answer clients was clearly not working out.
                                    My hope with this bootcamp is to learn and build out my own idea. I mean, what can
                                    be cooler than having your own startup?
